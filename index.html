	<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">My Name is Jacob Brakespeare, I am a 22 year old West Australian.<br>
	I am very proud of my mixed Race,<br> I can track my heritage all the way to the first nation peoples of The U.S & Canada,<br>From my African American forefathers on my fathers side,<br>
	 And to the First Europeans From Ireland and Sweden to Make Australia Their Home on my mothers Side.<br>
	This has lead me to learn more about the history of my ancestors and of various nations around the world,<br> I love history, the good, the bad, the Crazy and everything in-between.<br>
	I also have a love for Movies, Books, Video games & Music,<br> all of which at some point in my life shaped me into who I am</p>

	<h1 style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">Why do i want to work in I.T.?</h1>
<font face="New Times Roman" size="6px" color="#66ffff">
	<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">Every time I think about my dream field of work, I come to several possibilities,<br>
	which lead to an uncertainty, but I realised that all of them had one thing in common,<br>
	they were all included within the branches of IT. Whether it was video game development,<br>
	Sound design, online content creation or music production, they all had a solid grounding in the IT space.<br>
	As someone that hasn’t had allot of job security, and injuries that prevent me from returning to the industries I had previously worked in,<br>
	I wanted to find something that would give me more stability, or at the very least More flexibility. And the answer for me was IT.</p>

	<h1 style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">What is my ideal job?</h1>
	<font face="New Times Roman" size="6px" color="#66ffff">
	<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">
	The one job that stands above the rest for me would be video game design, specifically a level & layout design.<br>
	 I love video games, they’re an artform I could spend the rest of my life studying and experiencing happily,<br>
	 one of my favourite things about them is level design. A good level layout can tell its own story,<br>
	 through the art, architecture, the flow and decisions it can force players to make decisions both passive and actively.<br>
	 I would love to be apart of the creation process, so what I’m saying is my ideal job would be in video game level design.</p>

	I honestly don’t care for these test result in any real capacity,<br>

	<h1 style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">My BIG idea</h1>
	<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">	Coming up with a big idea wasn’t something I was planning on so early in this course, I truly didn’t know if I was confident enough to come up with such an answer, but I took a step back and asked myself what would I enjoy making, and just like everything else in my life, the answer was those 
Gosh Dang Vidya Games, that’ll rot my brain and turn my eyes square. So, I decided my BIG idea would actually be a little puzzle game.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">
I have spent the majority of my life playing video games and want to actively work in the industry so the idea of making a video game isn’t by any means a foreign or unwanted thought, in fact independently making a small indie puzzle game would be a great display of talent, test of skill and a great material achievement to display on a resume. The video game industry made over $162.32 Billion in 2020 alone, that is plenty of evidence that there is a demand for them, especially with that whole global pandemic going on at the moment. I hope that the pandemic isn’t a factor by the time I enter the industry, but my point was that the growth the industry saw in 2020 will have a permanent effect in the long term</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">
The product I wish to make would be an isometric, 2D, puzzle game hopefully made via the use of Unity. The product would offer a light hearted short story told through the progression of the player character using environmental movement and basic pairing skills to solve short puzzles. it would provide a challenge through resource management (in this case limiting the amount of movement the player character can perform), elemental pairing (using certain in game elements and making them necessary to activate specific tools in the environment), and to use level and layout design to create intuitive and restricting environmental traversal. It would be a free to play game with no additional transactions. this would encourage the purchase of the game without the worry of any long term commitment on the part of the consumer, that other free to play games suffer from. The game would provide a much wanted service to the people, entertainment, one of the most sought after luxuries in modern life. (I’m gonna be real with you chief, I can’t extend this description to 500-ish words, so I’m gonna stop here)</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">
Luckily there are tools and techniques used in the trade that are publicly available, to varying degrees, such as the raspberry pie, I sweet little developers kit that has made its way into schooling and industry use. Unity was my planned program, its developers kit technology would be accessible on my current PC hardware, and has shown itself to be an effective engine used by massive industry giants like the morally bankrupt riot games,  and by countless independent developers, showing that it has the range and capacity to provide the service I would need.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">
I Believe the necessary skills need for this idea would require programming experience and understanding, along with study of game design, and to earn some experience with the unity kit. Luckily for me I have already started to take the first step towards this goal, by entering university.</p>
<p style="background-color:rgb(64, 64, 64, 0.5);">
The outcome of all of this will hopefully be a massive experience gain on my part in the creation of this untitled game, and would result in me having physical evidence on my part, to help display my skill to any suitable employer.</p>
